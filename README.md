# CBCF
Configurable Bucket Cuckoo Filter (CBCF)

Description

The goal of CBCF is to reduce the False Positive Rate of Cuckoo filters operating below full capacity. This code is used in the paper "CBCF: Making Cuckoo Filters Better than Bloom Filters at Practical Occupancy" by P. Reviriego, J. Martínez, D. Larrabeiti and S. Pontarelli
Compilation

This Visual Studio C++ project consists of 3 files: CF.hpp (declaration file), CF.cpp (source file) and main.cpp (test bench)
Command line arguments

Command line arguments for CBCF are:

    m: filter mode, default value is 1 for cbcf, 0 is for standard cf
    s: filter size, default value is 8192
    o: filter occupancy, default value is 95%
    r: runs (trials), default value is 10000
    b: scrubbing, default value is 1
    i: scrub iterations, default value is 20
    f: fingerprint_bits, default value is f = {12, 15, 18}

example: cbcf.exe i=30 r=5000 f=12
